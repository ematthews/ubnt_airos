ubnt_airos
==========

This is a collection of scripts that I am using to communicate with AirOS devices, specifically Nanostations, from the awesome Ubiquiti Networks.

Requirements
------------
```
sudo pip install requests json argparse
```

Exection
--------
```
python get_status.py -u ubnt -p ubnt 192.168.0.20
```

This will dump out the basic JSON contents of status.cgi.

More to come!!
